#
# This is a "complete" Grit configuration file.
#
# It is written in TOML - https://github.com/toml-lang/toml
# All directives have sensible defaults... well, I think they're sensible.
#

#
# The clone section controls how Grit clones from your Git sources.
#
[clone]

# "root" is the base directory for all Git clones created via Grit.
#
# The target directory is <root>/<git host>/<repo slug>.
#
# The slug is simply the path portion of the Git URL, without the .git
# extension, or any other extension.
#
# For example, using a
# root of "~/grit" (which happens to be the default), the command:
#
#   grit clone jmalloc/grit
#
# Will clone git@github.com:jmalloc/grit.git to ~/grit/github.com/jmalloc/grit
root = "~/my-repos"

# "order" controls the order that Grit checks the "clone.sources" list.
#
# The repository is cloned from the first source that has a repository with a
# matching name.
#
# The default value is built from the list of "clone.sources" (see below) in
# random order, plus 'github' last.
order = ['my-company', 'github']

# "clone.sources" is a list of additional Git sources.
#
# The key is an arbitrary label for the source, referenced by the "clone.order"
# configuration directive, but otherwise unused by Grit.
#
# The value is a template for Git URL. The string {{ .Slug }} is substituted
# with the "<slug>" command-line argument.
#
# See https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/ for documentation about the
# templating system.
#
# The sources list always includes an implicit 'github' entry, which uses
# the URL "git@github.com:{{ .Slug }}.git". This can be explicitly overriden if
# you wanted to use the HTTPS URLs instead, for example.
[clone.sources]
my-company = "git@github.example.com:{{ .Slug }}.git"

#
# The index section controls how Grit indexes your Git clones.
#
[index]

# "root" is the base directory that is indexed when performing a complete
# rebuild of the index. The $GOPATH/src directory is also indexed.
#
# The default value is the same as the "clone.root" configuration directive,
# which itself defaults to "~/grit".
#
# Cloning a repository using Grit *always* adds that repository to the index,
# even if it's not inside the index root. However, any repositories outside the
# index root will be removed from the index if the index is rebuilt.
root = "~"

# "store" is the location to store the index database.
# The default value is "~/.grit/index.db".
store = "/tmp/grit-test/cache"
